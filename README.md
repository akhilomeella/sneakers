This project is inspired by one of the Frontend Mentor challenges and showcases a clean, responsive e-commerce product page for sneakers.

Although the original challenge suggested using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I chose to build the project using React.js and Tailwind CSS to practice component-based development and modern styling techniques.
